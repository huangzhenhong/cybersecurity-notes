### Important Terminology

Reconnaissance --Identifying information about the target before attacking.
Penetration Test -- A method of evaluating the security of a network or computer system by simulating an attack by a malicious hacker without harming and with the owner's written consent.
Ethical Hacker -- A security professional who legally attempts to break into a computer system or network to find its vulnerabilities.
Ethical Hack --A type of hack done to help a company or individual identify potential threats on the organization’s IT infrastructure or network.
Footprinting -- Identifying the size and scope of the target network.
Rootkit -- A collection of software tools that gives a threat actor remote access to and control over a computer or other system.
Enumeration -- A technique used to extract user names, machine names, network resources, shares, and services from a target.
Scanning -- Collects more information using complex and aggressive reconnaissance techniques.
Encryption — The process of rendering sensitive data unreadable through substitution and transposition using a mathematical function (algorithm) 
Confidentiality — the protection of sensitive data from unauthorized disclosure
Integrity — The measure of accuracy or precision of an entity or process
Availability —  the measure of the criticality of an entity and the value of the entity to supporting a business process
Non-repudiation — The ability to link actions to an individual entity  
Threat — Any circumstance or event with the potential to adversely impact organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation through an information system via unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, or modification of information, and/or denial of service.
Attack — Any kind of malicious activity that attempts to collect, disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information system resources or the information itself.
Vulnerability — Weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited by a threat source.
Risk Acceptance — The level of risk within the limits set by the risk owner
Information Security Risk — The risk to organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation due to the potential for unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of information and/or information systems.
Incident — an adverse event with the potential to affect business mission
